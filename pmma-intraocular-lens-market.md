<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PMMA Intraocular Lens Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hydrophilic</li><li>Hydrophobic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The PMMA intraocular lens market is categorized into hydrophilic and hydrophobic types, based on their water affinity. Hydrophilic lenses, which attract water, offer enhanced biocompatibility and can reduce glare, though they may be more prone to deposits. In contrast, hydrophobic lenses repel water, making them less susceptible to opacification and providing better stability in the eye. Both types cater to specific patient needs and preferences in cataract surgery, influencing choices made by surgeons and patients alike.</p></p>
