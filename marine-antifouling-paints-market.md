<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Marine Antifouling Paints Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-Polishing Copolymer (SPC) Coatings</li><li>Fouling Release Coatings (FRC)</li><li>Ablative Type</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The marine antifouling paints market includes several types of coatings designed to prevent biofouling on ship hulls and underwater structures. Self-Polishing Copolymer (SPC) coatings release biocides gradually as they degrade, maintaining efficacy over time. Fouling Release Coatings (FRC) create a slick surface that minimizes organism adhesion without biocides. Ablative types erode over time, continuously shedding fouling organisms. Other coatings might involve hybrid technologies or eco-friendly formulations, catering to specific environmental regulations and performance requirements in maritime applications.</p></p>
