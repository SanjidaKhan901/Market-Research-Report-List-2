<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hernia Patch Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable</li><li>Non-absorbable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The hernia patch market is divided into absorbable and non-absorbable types. Absorbable patches are designed to gradually break down and be absorbed by the body, promoting natural tissue healing while minimizing long-term foreign material presence. In contrast, non-absorbable patches remain permanently implanted, offering lasting support and durability but potentially leading to chronic complications. Both types cater to different surgical needs and patient profiles, with choices depending on factors like hernia type, patient health, and desired healing outcomes.</p></p>
