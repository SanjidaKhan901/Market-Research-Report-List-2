<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vehicle Side Airbag Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Side Torso Airbags</li><li>Side Tubular or Curtain Airbags</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The vehicle side airbag market comprises primarily two types: side torso airbags and side tubular (or curtain) airbags. Side torso airbags are designed to protect the torso of occupants during side-impact collisions, deploying between the door and the occupant. In contrast, side tubular airbags provide protection for the head and neck by creating a cushioning barrier that deploys from the roofline. Together, these airbags enhance passenger safety by mitigating injury risks during side-impact events in vehicles.</p></p>
